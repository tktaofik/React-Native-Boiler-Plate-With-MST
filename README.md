# React Native Boiler Plate Using Mobx State Tree
Based on [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

## Getting Started

### Installation
-   Install home brew [Home brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
-   Install Expo Command line `npm install -g exp`
-   Install React native debugger `brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger`
-   Install dependencies `npm i` 
-   Start application `npm start` 

#### `npm start`
Runs your app in development mode 

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).

#### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

**Warning:** Running eject is a **permanent** action. Please use a version control system, such as git, so you can revert back if necessary. An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) set up.
